# MediCall: AI Medication Adherence Assistant

“Your daily dose of assurance.”

MediCall is an AI-powered, multilingual calling assistant that keeps patients on track with their prescriptions and keeps families in the loop. By combining automated voice reminders, adherence tracking, and escalation workflows, the platform solves the last-mile problems of medication management—especially for elderly or low-tech users.

## Problem Statement

Millions of patients miss medicines because of complex schedules, language barriers, limited caregiver supervision, and the absence of timely follow-ups. The result is avoidable health risks, rehospitalizations, and anxiety for families who cannot always be present.

## Our Solution

MediCall automates every reminder touchpoint:

- Places AI phone calls at exact dosage times in the patient’s preferred language.  
- Logs whether the medicine was taken, missed, or declined.  
- Escalates unanswered calls to registered family heads and caregivers.  
- Stores adherence data in a dashboard so care teams can intervene quickly.

This creates an end-to-end ecosystem that blends telephony, AI, and caregiver coordination.

## How It Works

1. Family head registers the patient, medicines, schedule, and language preference.  
2. The scheduling engine triggers calls at the right time.  
3. The AI agent reminds the patient, captures their response, and records it.  
4. If there is no response, the agent retries and escalates to family heads.  
5. Dashboards collect logs, adherence trends, and pill inventory signals for restocking.

## Key Features

- **Automated AI Call Agent** – Human-like multilingual reminders with retry and escalation logic.  
- **Medication Tracking** – Per-dose logs, adherence analytics, and pill inventory awareness.  
- **Family & Patient Management** – Multiple families, patients, and family heads with clear escalation hierarchies.  
- **Unified Escalation Workflow** – Calls → confirmations → escalation → restock notifications happen inside one system.  
- **Low-Tech Accessibility** – Works via voice calls, so users who cannot rely on smartphones still stay compliant.

## Impact

- Dramatically reduces missed doses and improves long-term treatment outcomes.  
- Gives families real-time visibility and peace of mind.  
- Helps healthcare providers monitor adherence without constant manual follow-up.  
- Keeps elderly or low-literacy users engaged through natural conversations instead of screens.

## Tech Stack (Current Prototype)

- React + Vite frontend for management dashboards.  
- Voice/telephony layer for AI-driven outbound calls (provider integration in progress).  
- Secure backend for scheduling, escalation workflows, and data persistence.
